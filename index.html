    <p>Some People are not beliving in their self because of fear, ignorance, etc.
     That is why people start to fail in either their business, sports, computer careers.
     and it is not a delibrate thing. I mean it is not a crime to not Believe in Yourself but
     it is not a very good thing. If you want to Believe In Yourself, you have to lack ignorance.
     If you want to have success, you have to belive in Yourself.</p>
